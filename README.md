1. Understanding the Grammar and Implementing Input Handling

Grammar Understanding Documentation:
o Document the grammar rules provided in the problem statement.
o Explain each rule in detail, including examples and explanations of how they 
contribute to forming valid arithmetic expressions.
o Clarify any ambiguities or questions regarding the grammar rules.

Input Handling Implementation:
o Implement a function or class method to accept input from the user.
o Develop a mechanism to tokenize the input string into individual tokens based on 
the grammar rules.
o Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid input characters or syntax errors.
o Store the tokens in a suitable data structure for further processing.


2. Lexical Analysis (Tokenization):-

 

Implement a lexical analyser that breaks input strings into tokens based on the grammar rules. Each token should represent a meaningful unit of the input language.
Utilize regular expressions or other suitable techniques to match input patterns and generate tokens accordingly.
Ensure that the lexical analyser can handle whitespace, comments, and other irrelevant characters gracefully.
 
3. Parsing Algorithm:-

 

Choose a parsing algorithm (e.g., recursive descent, LL(1), LR(1)) that suits the complexity of your grammar.
Implement the parsing algorithm using object-oriented design principles. Define classes to represent the grammar rules, parse tree nodes, and other relevant components.
Develop methods for parsing input tokens and constructing a parse tree or generating parse results.
